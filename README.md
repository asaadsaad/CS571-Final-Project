# CS571 - Mobile Application Development
## Final Project 
**This is an individual project.**
### Application specifications and requirements
You will create a mobile application to help users find assistance seeking services from volunteers during the time of the novel covid-19 pandemic.  
Your app should be able to track user's location and display a map for volunteers who offer their time to help. Users will be able to change their volunteering state (on/off). Your system will only show those who have their volunteering state 'on'.  
  
Your project must include the following:
* Implement a login based system using JSON Web Token (JWT).
* Use UI Kit.
* Use Expo SDK APIs.
* Use Express/MongoDB for supportive backend API. All Express routes should be protected from public access by JWT (except sign up and sign in routes)  
* Users should be able to update their volunteering state easily.
* After searching for the nearest volunteers, the system will allow users to communicate over SMS, an SMS will be sent from the user needing the service with a message to the volunteer.
  
**Remember to respect and honor the code honor submission policy. All written code must be original.**  
  
Project will be evaluated based on your code quality (not quantity). I may need to schedule a meeting with some students to discuss their code-source.  

**Deadline is Monday, May 11th, 12:00 PM noon** 
  
**Good luck and happy coding!**
